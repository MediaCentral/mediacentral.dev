Lightning CSS is an extremely fast CSS parser. So fast that you don't need to precompile your CSS. Instead you can run it on the fly with Deno, or in the browser.

The configuration enables you to output css compatiable with target browser versions.

It pasrses modern CSS syntax such as nesting. https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting-1/
