The content must be in a Section. Include the section within the page template:

```liquid
{% section 'about' %}
```

Save the file `/sections/about.liquid` and place the editable content along with the schema.

The [section scheme](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema) tag `{% schema %} ... {% endschema %}` allows you to define various attributes of a section, such as the section name, any section blocks and settings to allow for theme editor customization options.

The `name` attribute determines the section title that is shown in the theme editor (in the left hand menu when customizing the page). 

The `settings` attribute holds all the data about the editable fields. It is an array of objects, with each object representing an input. 

The required attributes of an input are `type`, `id` and `label`.

:::caution

All section setting IDs must be unique within each section. Having duplicate IDs within a section will result in an error.

:::

The [Input Settings](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings) page lists all the different types available such as `text`, `textarea`, `checkbox` and `image_picker`.

You can create `blocks` for a section. Blocks are reusable modules of content that can be added, removed, and reordered within a section.

```liquid
{% schema %}
{
  "name": "About",
  "settings": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "id": "mytitle",
      "label": "My Title"
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}
```

Use setting values in the liquid template by referencing the `id`.

```liquid
<h1>{{ section.settings.mytitle }}</h2>
```

It is preferable to use `richtext` for text requiring parapgraphs and basic markup such as bold and links. Otherwise, when using `textarea` line breaks will not show by default. Line breaks can be added with a filter.

```liquid
{{ section.settings.mytextarea | newline_to_br }}
```
