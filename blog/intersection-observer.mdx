## Animation

Using Intersection Observer and Tailwind for a "fade-in and up" animation.

```
<script>
  const fadeinupList = document.querySelectorAll(".fadeinup")

  const callback = (entries, observer) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        entry.target.classList.remove("translate-y-4", "opacity-0", "sm:translate-y-4", "sm:opacity-0")
      }
    });
  };

  const options = {
    root: null,
    rootMargin: '-100px',
    threshold: 0
  }

  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options)

  fadeinupList.forEach(item => {
    observer.observe(item)
  })
</script>
```

## Installation

1. Add the above js at the bottom of the page. 

2. Add the `fadeinup` class to any element that will be animated.

3. The animated element needs the transition settings for the initial state.

Basic example:

```html
class="transition transform translate-y-10 opacity-0 fadeinup"
```

Responsive example, with delay:

```html
class="transition duration-1000 transform sm:delay-300 sm:translate-y-4 sm:opacity-0 fadeinup"
```

In the above example the delay is only applied on breakpoints `sm` and up. This is useful when we want a slight delay on additional columns, but on mobile there is no delay.

In this example, the fade-in and translate-up are also only applied on breakpoints `sm` and up.

Be sure that all the classes are set to be removed to affect the animation.

```js
entry.target.classList.remove("translate-y-4", "opacity-0", "sm:translate-y-4", "sm:opacity-0")
```

## Options

`rootMargin: '-100px'` means the element will need to be scrolled 100px into the viewport before it is triggered.

threshold of 0 means as soon as any part of the element is visible it will be triggered. A value of 1 means the entire element must be visible to be triggered. Or it can be any fraction e.g. 0.5
