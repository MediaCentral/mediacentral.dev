## HTTP server

Examples using the HTTP server from the built in Deno standard library.

https://deno.com/deploy/docs/examples

```
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.155.0/http/server.ts";
```

## JSX

### Preact

This can be extended to render from JSX by including Preact and `preact-render-to-string`.

https://deno.com/deploy/docs/examples#ssr-jsx-preact

Note that some examples use a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file extension, so Deno Deploy knows to interpret a given file as JSX/TSX.

### Nano JSX

Another option is to use [Nano JSX](https://github.com/nanojsx/nano) as shown in this example:

https://deno.com/deploy/docs/using-jsx

### Nano SSR

Website in a single file

https://deno.com/blog/a-whole-website-in-a-single-js-file

https://deno.com/blog/a-whole-website-in-a-single-js-file-continued

This example uses [nanossr](https://github.com/AaronO/nanossr), which is a tiny server-side renderer that uses Nano JSX with twind under the hood for styling.
